## Audience

Who are you targeting?
 
### 1. Existing audience

The people who are looking specifically for you.

Example:
>> I live in Ohio and I want to take a hot air balloon ride. My friend recommended a company, something with the name "Bella" in it, but I don't know the domain. I go to Google and type in "Bella hot air balloon rides" to try and find their site."

Searh phrase: *&ldquo;Bella hot air balloon rides&rdquo;*

### 2. New audience

The people who are searching for something in general related to you and you want them to land on your site.

Example: 
>> I live in Ohio and I want to take my mom on a hot air balloon ride for her birthday. I don't know any specific companies that do this so I just type in "hot air balloon rides Ohio."

Search phrase: *&ldquo;hot air balloon rides Ohio.&rdquo;*



## Search Engines

1. Google
2. Yahoo/Bing
3. Everyone else

## How engines work

Crawler-based search engines

To see how Google has indexed your (or any) site, do a google search, prefixing it with `site:` (no space)

Example:

`site:flybellaballoons.com`
