## Title Element

`<title>`

* In head of your HTML document; describes the content of the page.

* Use different titles for different pages&mdash; don't just repeat across your site.
* Be descriptive yet concise, incorporate keywords.
* 60-70 characters.
* Incorporate keywords you want people to use to find you.
* Don't waste space: *Official website*, *very*, *best*, *really*.
* Whether you include your name depends on your audience target.




## Meta Description

```
<meta name="description" content="Bella Balloons provides Ohio Hot Air Balloon Rides, Cincinnati Hot Air Balloon Rides, and Dayton Hot Air Balloon Rides.">
```

* Also in the head of the your document.
* Never displayed on the page.
* Usually the summary listed under your headline in search results.
* Be descriptive yet concise, incorporate keywords. 130-155 characters.
* Use different descriptions for each page. 
* Short descriptions can easily get lost, so aim for two lines of text.
* Occasionally search engines will override your description.
* Search terms found in your description will be bolded in results.
* Keywords meta tag is no longer used.




## Headings

* Heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)&mdash; not just for styling.
* Clue to search engine what your site is about.
* Like title and meta tags, you want to be sure your headings include relevant keywords where necessary.




## Links

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/seo-good-bad-links.png'>

* Don't label links *Click here*&mdash; waste of link power. 
* Links are how search engine bots crawl through your site.
* Anchor text (the part you click) is associated with the URL.
* [Remove `www` from URLs](https://gist.github.com/susanBuck/9240424)




## Images
* Use alt attributes for all your non-decorative images.
* Use descriptive file names: `logo4.jpg` vs. `bella-balloons-logo.jpg`
