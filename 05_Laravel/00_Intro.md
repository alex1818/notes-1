## Starting assumptions

* You have a local server running using MAMP.
* You have a working understanding of using the CL.
* Windows users: All CL instructions assume you're working from [Cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/).
* You have a working understanding of Git.
* When you run `git` in the CL, the command is found (i.e. Git for CL is installed).
* When you run `php` in the CL, the command is found.

If you have any issues with the above, revisit the note *Version Control* and/or *SysAdmin* notes.
