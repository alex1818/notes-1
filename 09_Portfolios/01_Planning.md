Avoid fluff, vague language:
>> I've been designing and building websites happily for years, and am proud to be part of a world-wide community of designers and developers working to make the internet a prettier, more productive place to be for everyone. I try to maintain an understanding of all technologies which can make a web-site not just work, but excel at its task. From project conception, all the way to launch, I'm proud that I can help my clients to realize projects which exceed expectations, and allow them to make the most of their on-line homes.

Be specific:
>> My websites are built from the ground up using technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. Over the past year I've shifted my focus towards Responsive Web Design. So, why Responsive Web Design? Well to help you better visualize the importance of RWD all you really need to see are the numbers. The following shows you the percent mobile traffic accounts for based off all web traffic in the World from the past 3 years. In Q1 of 2011 mobile web traffic only accounted for 4.5%. A year later you see that percentage jump from 4.5% to 13.14% in Q1 of 2012. In Q1 of 2013 mobile traffic continues to grow (23.86%) and analysts are predicting that mobile traffic will overtake desktop traffic in 2014.
