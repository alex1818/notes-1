## Task

Create a simple website for Mariposa Bakery in Cambridge

Background: <http://www.yelp.com/biz/mariposa-bakery-cambridge>

Example: <http://mariposa.wcc-hosting.com/>




## Create your directory structure and download images
Create a directory called `mariposa/` somewhere on your local computer.

Inside of it, create a subdirectory called `images/`.

Download the following images to `/mariposa/images`:

* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/html-exercise-butterfly-logo.png>
* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/html-exercise-coffee-and-snack.jpg>
* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/html-exercise-menu.pdf>




## Build the index page
Next, create a file called `index.html` in the root of your `mariposa` folder.

Inside of `index.html` lay out the basic HTML structure for a page, and in the `<body>` include this heading element:

	<h1>Welcome to Mariposa Bakery</h1>

Load this file in your browser and make sure it works.

Now, continue to build out the index making it match the example:

* Remembe to fill in your `<title>` element in the head of the page.
* Add the logo up top
* Use a `<h2>` element for the words `Central Square, Cambridge MA` that's right below the `<h1>`.
* Create a paragraph element for the description: `Quaint, brick-walled bakery with WiFi serving homemade goodies, sandwiches and espresso drinks.`
* Create a link to Mariposa's Yelp page. 
	* The URL is `http://www.yelp.com/biz/mariposa-bakery-cambridge`. 
	* This link should load in a new tab.
* Create a link to a page you'll create later, called `menu.html`
* Create `<h2>` element that says `This Month's Specials`
* Below this `<h2>`, create an unordered list element with the three specials listed in the example

## Build the menu page

With the index page complete, move on to the menu page and make it match the one in our example. 

The menu of items is created using an HTML table, which you can find an [example of here](http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_tables.asp).
