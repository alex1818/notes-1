## To Do: Set up pages and menu

Create pages via *Pages :: Add New*

1. Home
2. Portfolio
3. Contact
4. Blog

Organize the menu via *Appearance :: Menu*

* Remove *Home* (page) and *Sample Page* from the menu.
* Order: *Portfolio, Contact, Blog, Home*
* Click *Create Menu* and then set it to be the *Primary Menu*

Disable comments on pages via a page's *Quick Edit* section.

## Customize Theme
* Clear out any remaining widgets for a minimal look via *Appearance :: Widgets*
* Upload a header via *Appearance :: Header* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-graphics-by-liz-header.png>
* While still in the theme editor, under *Header Image* uncheck *Show header text with your image.* and remove the Tagline.
* Set background color to white via the *Colors* option.




## Reading Settings
Right now when you land on the site it shows recent blog posts, which doesn't match the goal of our project. 

In *Settings :: Reading* change the Front page display to *A static page*

Make the Front page set to *Home*

And the Posts page set to *Blog*

Here's some sample copy for the Home page:





## What's next?
We've maxed out the theme's customziations. If you wanted to customize further, you'd have to hit the code.

You can see the code via *Appearance :: Editor* but it's not suggested you make edits here because if you ever needed to update your theme you'd lose all your work.

Instead, you'd want to create a Child Theme. You can read more about that here: <http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes>
