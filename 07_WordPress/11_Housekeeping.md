## Security

* Pick strong passwords:

	* Hosting Login
	* MySQL Database password
	* WordPress wp-admin
	* Your email password (because any of the above can be reset with access to your email account).
	
* Don't use the username "admin" when setting up your WordPress site (&ldquo;The Club&rdquo; principle).
* Use separate usernames and passwords for all your logins.
* Pick solid Themes and Plugins.
* Keep WordPress, Themes and Plugins up to date.
* Install a Security Plugin such as [WordFence](http://wordfence.com/)
