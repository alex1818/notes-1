## Why use WordPress?

### You need a blog.

### You need a CMS:

>> A web content management system (web CMS) is a bundled or stand-alone application to create, manage, store and deploy content on Web pages. Web content includes text and embedded graphics, photos, video, audio, and code (e.g., for applications) that displays content or interacts with the user. A web CMS may catalog and index content, select or assemble content at runtime, or deliver content to specific visitors in a requested way, such as other languages. Web CMSs usually allow client control over HTML-based content, files, documents, and web hosting plans based on the system depth and the niche it serves.

You want to build a website for a client that they can manage and manipulate without your help.
You want to build a website that you can easily manage and manipulate the content of.

### You need a feature
Your site needs some specific features, but your coding skills are not advanced enough to create them on your own, or what you need is not so specific that you have to "reinvent the wheel".

Examples:

* You own a white water rafting company and on your site you regularly want to upload photos from your trips. You need a [photo album manager](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-photo-album/screenshots/).
* You run a tech conference and you want participants to be able to submit feedback that gets emailed to you. You need a [survey tool](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-simple-survey/screenshots/).
* You're working on a client's site for their restaurant. They want you to build them an online menu, but their menu changes frequently depending on the seasons so the client needs to easily be able to edit the menu. You need a [menu manager](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-restaurant-menu-manager/screenshots/).

## Easyhard
Depends on your relative experience and your expectations/needs.

Easy because there are so many plugins you can fire up with just a few clicks.

Challenging because getting these plugins to do what you want can be tricky, and can require advanced experience with HTML/CSS/PHP/JavaScript.

Find a theme that looks exactly how you want and the prefect plugins that operate exactly how you want? **WordPress is easy**.

Found a theme that looks about 80% right and plugins that do 80% of what you need? You've got to fill in a 20% gap in a code-heavy, sophisticated system. **WordPress is hard**.
