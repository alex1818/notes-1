## Why we wireframe?

Wireframing is a good way to remove the distractions of the visual and asses the barebones of a site. It is the ideal time to think about hierarchy placing what&rsquo;s important on a prime screen real estate or allowing it to take up different amounts of space on the screen. Here designers can move elements (pictures, links, ad space, slideshows, instructional text, buttons etcÉ) on a page quickly. They can quickly create several versions that give different elements more emphasis allowing the clients to have more options. 

## Types of wireframes

### Low Fidelity (Lo-fi)
These wireframes are typically rough sketches on pencil and paper. You&rsquo;ll find them on index cards or even napkins. They are a great way to get out ideas quickly. Some designers don&rsquo;t consider sketches as lo-fi wireframes. Lo-fi wireframes can be computer generated where elements are blocks of varying shades of grey accompanied by titles but leaves much to interpretation. 
 
### Medium Fidelity 
Typically you&rsquo;ll hear about low-fi and hi-fi wireframes and prototypes but it&rsquo;s perfectly okay to label them as Medium Fidelity. These have more description than lo-fi wireframes. They can start to have actual content in the most essential areas such as navigation links, footer, to hierarchical typography suggestions. 

### High Fidelity (hi-fi)
High Fidelity wireframes can have real content to dummy text but here the elements are laid out with precise proportions and locations. Sometimes they can contain color and even utilize pre-made or stock elements so that the client will have a better visualization of how these elements will function.

In all wireframing types it is important to set the expectations and goals for each wireframe. For instance the client might mistake a low fidelity wireframe for being the final experience which might make them nervous in the meeting. The same concern stands for high fidelity wireframes especially if the stock elements don&rsquo;t match their brand. 

### $$ User Flow
How the user travels from one page to the next is called a user flow. This can be done before during or after the wire framing page. Here we create site maps or flow charts to figure out the appropriate structure for the site. I&rsquo;ve used MindJet MindManager for this in the past. 

### Prototyping
Once the wireframes are situated we might move on to prototyping if the interactions or designs are complicated enough. This helps communicated our ideas for interaction and user flow in a more visual way. Prototypes usually help rally the team getting developers and clients excited about this functionality. Prototyping also has degrees of fidelity in 3 dimensions visual, functional, and content. They can be combined in various ways to achieve the best prototype for that particular functionality.

### Rapid Prototyping
Quick iterations of prototyping popular functionalities. It&rsquo;s a cycle with 3 stages; Review => Refine => Prototype. Sometimes it can replace the wire framing stage. 

&ldquo;A good rule of thumb is to focus on the 20% of the functionality that will be used 80% of the time&hellip;[r]emind everyone, including yourself, that rapid prototyping is a means to an end, not an end in itself.&rdquo; - Lyndon Cerejo (Smashing Mag: [Design Better and Faster with Rapid Prototyping](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/))
