## Ergonomics
Ergonomics emerged as a scientific discipline in the 1940s as a consequence of the growing realization that, as technical equipment became increasingly complex, not all of the expected benefits would be delivered if people were unable to understand and use the equipment to its full potential. British psychologist Hywel Murrell in 1949 used the term to encompass the studies in which he had been engaged during and after World War II.
	
## HCI (Human Computer Interaction)
First known use was in 1975. The term HCI connotes that, unlike other tools with only limited uses (such as a hammer, useful for driving nails, but not much else), a computer has many uses and this takes place as an open-ended dialog between the user and the computer. It is often regarded as the intersection of computer science, behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and several other fields of study.
