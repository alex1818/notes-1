## Goals
* Gain an introductory understanding of what, "User Experience" and related terms mean in today's context. Explore UX thinking, real world examples, research techniques, and analytical techniques.
* Utilize a select few of these techniques to experience a part of the UX world and discuss the implications of UX as technology evolves.

## Timeline
Where and how we do begin? Let's explore the origin of the term "User Experience." Where did it come from, how did it originate, how did it evolve?

Here's a brief incomplete timeline.

### 5th Century BC
Greek Hellenic civilizations were documented to have used ergonomic principles in the design of their tools, jobs, and workplaces. 

The "Father of Medicine," Hippocrates, gave a detailed description of how a surgeon's workplace should be designed and how his tools should be arranged.

### 1st Century BC
Vitruvius and his 3 core design principals:

1. **Firmitas**: The strength and durability of the design;
2. **Utilitas**: A design's usefulness and suitability for the needs of its intended users; 
2. **Venustas**: The beauty of the design 

"Vitruvius' work was an inspiration to people like Leonardo da Vinci, who drew the well-known Vitruvian Man (fig. 1 below). By empirically measuring and calculating the proportions of the human body, and emphasizing the ‘utilitas’ principle, Vitruvius may be considered the first student of ergonomics and usability.” [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/23/the-history-of-usability-from-simplicity-to-complexity/)

### 1900's  
Winslow Taylor pioneered the modern optimization of work, basing on his research of the interaction between workers and their tools. Taylor thought that by analyzing work, the "One Best Way" to do it would be found. This was the foundation for [scientific management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) also called, "Taylorism." He observed coal workers and discovered that there was an optimal weight and design for a shovel that increases the efficiency of shoveling coal. 

### 1913
Ford introduced moving assembly belts into his automobile plants. This move caused some controversy due to the dehumanization of workers (i.e., equating the employees to cogs in a system).

### Mid 20th Century
"Industrial efficiency and human ingenuity were striking a more harmonious relationship at places like Toyota, where the Toyota Production System continued to value efficiency, but treated workers as key contributors to a continually improving
process. One of the core tenets of the Toyota philosophy was “respect for people,” and it resulted in involving workers in troubleshooting and optimizing the processes that they were a part of. As one example, workers at Toyota factories could pull a rope called the Andon Cord to stop the assembly line and give feedback if they saw a defect or a way to improve the process."

### 1955 
Designing for People, Henry Dreyfuss [(Get the Book)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581153120/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1581153120&linkCode=as2&tag=uxbo09-20)

**World War I and World War II**

The World Wars fueled the research in and the development of the Human Factors field. 

"Thus, military designers could extract some very concrete usability metrics. For example: How quickly will a new crew member learn how to use the artillery cannon (now that the former crew member is dead)?" [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/23/the-history-of-usability-from-simplicity-to-complexity/)


### 1973
The term cognitive science was coined by Christopher Longuet-Higgins in his 1973 commentary on the Lighthill report, which concerned the then-current state of Artificial Intelligence research. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science)

### 1977
Personal computing. Electronic devices began to arrive in the consumer mass-market. 

### Early 1990's
Cognitive psychologist Donald Norman joined Apple.

"I invented the term because I thought Human Interface and usability were too narrow: I wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with a system, including industrial design, graphics, the interface, the physical interaction, and the manual." - Don Norman

He's most likely the first person to hold the title, "User Experience Architect."

### Mid 1990's
The Internet began to impact culture and commerce. This includes the rise electronic mail, instant messaging, and two-way interactive calling. 

### 2007
Apple Releases the iPhone.

### 2008
The release of the first phone to use Android called the HTC Dream (also known as the T-Mobile G1).
