&ldquo;UX is the intangible design of a strategy that brings us to a solution.&rdquo; 

~Erik Flowers Principle Designer at Intuit

## Goals
* Jump into an introductory understanding of what comes after knowing your users.
* Define various UX processes such as, &ldquo;Lean UX&rdquo; and &ldquo;Agile UX&rdquo;.
* Explain how to go about the other phases of UX such as wireframing, prototyping (including, &ldquo;Rapid Prototyping&rdquo;), and user testing.
	* Explore what tools are at our disposal for these phases.
	* View real world examples where companies have utilized these techniques.
* Discuss less common/futuristic types of technologies that inspire new UX and how it can help us re-invent present day UX in our everyday objects.

## Common UX Processes 

### UX Waterfall
Original UX process where things are approached in phases from Scoping &rarr; Designing &rarr; Development &rarr; Testing &rarr; Deployment. Once a single phase is completed it is not revisited, we simply move on to the next phase. There is some bad blood surrounding the waterfall method in both the dev and design world. This method usually results in a large assortment of deliverables after each process is completed. 

### Agile UX
This process is an attempt to integrate the UX development flow with the Agile Software Development methodology. Like its development counter part, Agile UX functions with constant iterations typically called sprints. The sprints are defined by scrum meetings where the scrum master will relay the scope for that particular sprint. Here the designer is constantly working in increments of scoping, designing, and testing until that sprint is complete. The sprints continue until the product is complete.  The foundation of Agile UX lies in a very close relationship between developers and designers. It is good for projects that need flexibility, as it is understood that requirements may change through these iterations. 

&ldquo;As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team&rsuo;s ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.&rdquo; - Wikipedia on Scrum (software development)

### Lean UX
An adaptation to Agile UX, Lean UX takes the iterative incremental process of Agile UX and applies them to a more business oriented model. It focuses on the cycles of, &ldquo;Build-Measure-Learn&rdquo; and the idea of solving problems. It was tailored to fit a more start-up type of environment when requirements and scopes are typically uncertain. As a result these iterations are quicker since the focus is on finding the best UX based on testing and prototyping instead of a more grounded knowledge of requirements.

&ldquo;Drake Martinet (Wall Street Journal, Stanford University) considers the whole lean startup movement to be a mere application of design principles to the business environment. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.&rdquo; - Smashing Mag [Beyond Wireframing Real Life UX Design Process](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/29/beyond-wireframing-real-life-ux-design-process/)
