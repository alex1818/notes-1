So far, you've got the flow set up between your local computer and your repo at Github, but there's one more piece of the puzzle: deploying your changes to your live server.

In this section we'll look at an example of how you would deploy to a **PaaS**. We'll use [PagodaBox](https://pagodabox.com/) because it supports PHP and provides free applications we can experiment with.

[Read more on the difference between a PaaS and traditional/shared hosting...](http://www.brmullikin.com/web-development).




## Pagoda setup

Create a new account at [PagodaBox](https://pagodabox.com/).

In your user settings, find the option to add a SSH key. You can copy the same `id_rsa.pub` key you created when you configured Github.

Mac: 

	$ edit /Users/YourName/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Windows:

	$ notepad C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\id_rsa.pub

## New Pagoda App
From your Pagoda dashboard, find the option to **add a New Application**.

Start your app with an **Empty Repo**. Give your new app a name; you can't call it `hello-world` because it'll already be taken, so try adding your name or some other unique value.

Click **Launch Application** to initiate your new app.

Side note: Because we already have our hello-world project setup up in Github.com we could have chosen the *Clone an Existng Repo* option. Going this route would change our upcoming steps slightly, but the end result is the same either way.

On the next screen, choose Git as your deployment method. Pagoda will also give you a series of CL commands. Because your repository is already initiated you only need to run the 4th line which will add Pagoda as a new remote.

	$ git remote add pagoda git@git.pagodabox.com:hello-world-yourname.git

## Deploying

The final step is to push to Pagoda, which is what you'll do whenever you have changes you're ready to go live with changes.

	$ git push pagoda master

After your first deployment, you should now be able to access your app via `http://hello-world-yourname.gopagoda.com`. You can also manage your app from its dashboard on Pagoda.
