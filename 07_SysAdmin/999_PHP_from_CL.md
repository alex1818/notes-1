## Is PHP for CL set up?

First, let's see if you already have the ability to run PHP from CL.

Mac or Windows, run this command:

	php -v
	
If it reports back on the version of php, you're all set and you don't need to do anything else in this doc.

If, however, it says the command is not found, you have some configuring to do. 

The following instructions are Windows-centric, as php is installed by default on Mac computers.




## Where is php.exe?
First: Locate a copy of `php.exe`. Assuming you have MAMP installed, you should find one in `C:\MAMP\bin\php\php5.5.7\` (replace the version number with whichever you want to use). 

To test this out, try the `-v` flag again, this time specifying the full path to php:

	$ C:\MAMP\bin\php\php5.5.7\php.exe -v

If this doesn't report back on the version of PHP, dig around your `C:\MAMP\bin\php` folder for a copy of `php.exe`.

Now that you know where php.exe lives, you can add it's directory to your *PATH variable*...





## Add php to your PATH variable

**What is a PATH variable?** When you run a command in the CL, it looks for the corresponding executable file using the directories listed in your *PATH variables* as a map. Given this, when you add a new executable, you may need to specify its directory in your PATH variable. 

Mac users, this command will show you your PATH variable:

	$ echo $PATH
	
Windows users, this command will show you your PATH variables:

	$ PATH

To edit your PATH variable on a Mac, follow these instructions: [Mac OSX Change Path Variables](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2621/os_x_change_path_environment_variable/).

Windows users, to edit your PATH variables goto *My Computer* > *Properties* > *Advanced* > *Environment Variables* > *Path*.

Each path in your PATH variable is separated by a semi-colon. Here's an example:

	%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;C:\Program Files\nodejs\;

Since you now know that there's a `php.exe` in `C:\MAMP\bin\php\php5.5.7\` you want to add this directory to your PATH variable:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-setting-path-variable-on-windows.png?@2x' class='' style='max-width:1371px; width:75%' alt=''>

Tip: The text input for editing the PATH variable is small and hard to work with... Copy your variable to a text editor to work with it there, then paste it back when you're done.

Make sure you end your path with a trailing backslash. The idea is to point to the directory where `php.exe` can be found, not the actual `php.exe` file..

Ok/Save your changes.

Restart your Command Line.

Test it out:

	php -v
	
You should now see version information about PHP; you have confirmed that you can execute PHP from the command line.



## Specify your php.ini file

To see what `php.ini` file CL is using when running php, run this command:

	$ php --ini
	
You should see that it's looking in `c:\Windows` by default:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/sysadmin-php-from-command-line-ini-location.png?@2x' class='' style='max-width:387px; width:75%' alt=''>

Let's create a `php.ini` file there for it to use:

	$ touch c:\Windows\php.ini

Load this new `php.ini` file in Notepad:

	$ notepad c:\Windows\php.ini	

Copy the contents of [this file](https://gist.github.com/susanBuck/73f7ca03344331fb9edf) and paste it in your php.ini file. 

Save.

Now check again what your ini settings are:

	$ php --ini
	
<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/sysadmin-php-from-command-line-ini-location-set.png?@2x' class='' style='max-width:469px; width:1' alt=''>




## Tips:
All PHP info (equivalent of `phpinfo()`)

	$ php -i

Run PHP with a specific PHP file

	$ php -c C:\MAMP\conf\php5.5.7\php.ini
